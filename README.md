# Intro to Object-Oriented Programming

## Learning Goals

- Build robust and dynamic Python objects.
- Accomplish complex programming tasks using knowledge from previous modules.

## Key Vocab

- **Class**: a bundle of data and functionality. Can be copied and modified to
accomplish a wide variety of programming tasks.
- **Initialize**: create a working copy of a class using its `__init__()`
method.
- **Instance**: one specific working copy of a class. It is created when a
class's `__init__()` method is called.
- **Object**: the more common name for an instance. The two can usually be used
interchangeably.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: programming that is oriented around data
(made mobile and changeable in **objects**) rather than functionality. Python
is an object-oriented programming language.
- **Function**: a series of steps that create, transform, and move data.
- **Method**: a function that is defined inside of a class.
- **Attribute**: variables that belong to an object.
- **Property**: attributes that are controlled by methods.
